# Frontend API Base URL (used at build time for Docker builds)
# Default: http://localhost:8000
# 
# For docker-compose, this works as-is since both services are accessible from host
# For standalone frontend container with external backend, update this URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Example for production with external backend:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com

# Example for docker-compose (backend service name - not needed, localhost works):
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://backend:8000
